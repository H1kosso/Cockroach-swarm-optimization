# Cockroach-swarm-optimization
This project is prepared for the completion of the subject 'Algorithm Optimization'

The cockroach swarm optimization (CSO) algorithm is inspired by the behavior of cockroaches looking for food, such as moving in swarms, scattering or escaping from light.

## Technologies
C++

Qt Widgets for UI

### Code
An algorithm is implemented in C++ in an object-oriented way.

"The interface has been fully implemented in QT Widgets.

The user has the ability to enter all the parameters, and then the graph of the currently found best global minimum and the graph of the function we are searching for this minimum are displayed.
