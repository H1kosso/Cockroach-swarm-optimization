# Cockroach-swarm-optimization
This project is prepared for the completion of the subject 'Algorithm Optimization'

The cockroach swarm optimization (CSO) algorithm is inspired by the behavior of cockroaches looking for food, such as moving in swarms, scattering or escaping from light.

## Technologies
C++
